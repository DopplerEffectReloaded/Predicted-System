# Predicted-System
This system is part of an app created to fully handle the predicted grades for CHIREC International School. It will be used for 3 types of users i.e the students, the teachers and the DP coordinater.

The features to be implemented are:

• Enter the Subject and corresponding marks out of 100. (All exams)

• Flexibility to change individual weightage.

• Excel Sheet Creation (Look into this) [Access to only DPC] – Name, Subject, Grade, UID grade out of 42 (12th only)

• App recommendation to achieve grade students want (Next possible grade recommendation) - How much more is required to achieve that grade

•Separate logins for teachers, students, and DPC to apply user based access constrictions

• Students some part – limited access

• Teachers more part – access over subject boundaries and weightages

• DPC full control – all subjects – boundaries, weightages, student grades etc.

The language currently used is python. In future it may change...
